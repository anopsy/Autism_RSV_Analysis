## Data Collection and Analysis of RSV Autism vs Autism Spectrum Disorder in different languages

### 1. Description
The goal of the project was to collect, combine and analyse data obtained from Google Trends.
My initial motivation to start this project was to perform a simple time series analysis of Relative Search Volumes for Autism vs Autism Spectrum Disorder.
I was interested if the trends changed across the time, with Autism Spectrum Disorder getting more popular over time.
At some point I decided that it would be even more interesting to do that for as many languages as possible.
I collected the names for Autism/Autism Spectrum Disorder in different languages from Wikipedia pages, downloaded the data from Google trends, joined, cleaned and aggregated the data.
I discovered few common characteristics for the time series across different languages and additionally employed geopandas to visualize the data.

### 2. Lessons learned
- Doing more in depth research on RSV from Google Trends to improve my understanding of the data I collected
- Model the time series for different countries as an excercise in time based cv and predictive modeling
  
### 3. Lessons learned
The most challenging part was to combine the RSV time series data with geographical data. I joined, melted/pivoted multiple tables. I also learned the basics of working with geopandas and discovered I really enjoy to visualize my data on a map. I learned how to spot common characteristics in the time series data and interpret them.
